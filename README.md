# Advanced regression assignment-Housing Price Prediction
## Project Overview
Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, aims to enter the Australian real estate market. To make informed investment decisions, they have collected a dataset from house sales in Australia. The company wants to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties. Additionally, they seek answers to the following questions:

#### 1.Significant Variables: 
Which variables significantly influence house prices?
#### 2.Price Description: 
How well do these variables describe house prices?
#### 3.Optimal Regularization: 
Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

# Business Goals
The developed model will serve several purposes for Surprise Housing:

#### 1.Strategic Insights: 
Understand how house prices vary with independent variables.
#### 2.Investment Strategy: 
Manipulate investment strategies based on variable impact.
#### 3.Market Dynamics: 
Gain insights into pricing dynamics in the Australian market.

## General Information of Project
##### What is the Background of a project?
- The background of our project involves Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company that intends to enter the Australian real estate market. Their goal is to use data analytics to purchase houses below their actual values and then sell 
  them at a higher price. To achieve this, they have collected a dataset from house sales in Australia. The company aims to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties. 
  Additionally, they want to understand which variables significantly impact house prices and how well these variables describe the pricing dynamics in the Australian market. The project will help guide their investment decisions and 
  provide insights into the new market
##### What is the business probem that a project is trying to solve?
- The business problem that our project aims to solve for Surprise Housing is to understand how house prices vary with different independent variables in the Australian real estate market. By building a regression model using regularization 
  techniques, the company can predict the actual value of prospective properties. This information will guide their investment decisions and help them strategically enter the new market
