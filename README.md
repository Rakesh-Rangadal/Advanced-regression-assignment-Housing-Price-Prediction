# Advanced regression Assignment-Housing Price Prediction
## Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know the following things about the prospective properties:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
- How well those variables describe the price of a house. Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
# Business Goals
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

The solution is divided into the following sections:

- Data understanding and exploration
- Data Visualisation
- Data preparation
- Model building and evaluation

## General Information of Project
##### What is the Background of a project?
- The background of our project involves Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company that intends to enter the Australian real estate market. Their goal is to use data analytics to purchase houses below their actual values and then sell 
  them at a higher price. To achieve this, they have collected a dataset from house sales in Australia. The company aims to build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties. 
  Additionally, they want to understand which variables significantly impact house prices and how well these variables describe the pricing dynamics in the Australian market. The project will help guide their investment decisions and 
  provide insights into the new market
##### What is the business probem that a project is trying to solve?
- The business problem that our project aims to solve for Surprise Housing is to understand how house prices vary with different independent variables in the Australian real estate market. By building a regression model using regularization 
  techniques, the company can predict the actual value of prospective properties. This information will guide their investment decisions and help them strategically enter the new market
